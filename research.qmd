## Research Project Requirement

The research project is a critical component of the MSDS program and serves as a capstone experience that demonstrates a student's mastery of data science methodologies and their application to real-world problems.

### Overview and Purpose

The project allows students to engage in independent or collaborative research under the guidance of faculty. It emphasizes originality, technical rigor, and clear communication of findings.

### Collaboration and Mentorship Guidelines

Students may work individually or in small teams. Projects must have a faculty mentor affiliated with the Data Science Institute (DSI). Collaborations with other departments or external organizations are permitted, but a DSI faculty member must be involved as supervisor.

### Project Approval Process

- **Proposal Submission**: Students must submit a written proposal outlining objectives, methodology, timeline, and mentorship structure.
- **Review and Approval**: Proposals are reviewed by a faculty panel or the Program Director.
- **Key Deadlines**: Proposal submission typically occurs by mid-Winter quarter.

### Project Completion Options

Students may choose one of the following formats to fulfill the project requirement:
- Oral presentation to a faculty review panel
- Written research paper
- Submission to a peer-reviewed journal (with faculty endorsement)

### Evaluation Criteria

Projects are evaluated on the following dimensions:
- **Originality and Innovation**
- **Methodological Rigor**
- **Communication Clarity**
- **Depth of Analysis and Discussion**
- **Practical Significance and Impact**

### Roles and Responsibilities
