## About the Data Science Institute

The **Data Science Institute (DSI)** at the University of Chicago embodies the university’s bold and innovative vision of data science as a distinct and transformative discipline.

Serving as an intellectual hub, DSI advances these three foundational goals:

- **Interdisciplinary Research** — Provide world-class research focused on big data and AI to tackle the most challenging societal and scientific problems.  
- **Outreach and Partnerships** — Foster outreach with partnerships across industry, government, academia, and social impact organizations to effect sustainable and scalable change.  
- **Data Science Education** — Lead a comprehensive educational mission through the Committee on Data Science (CODAS), which grants degrees in BA, BS, MS and PhD in our undergraduate, MSDS, MSADS, and PhD programs.
