## Welcome Message from the Director

Dear Students,

Welcome to the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program at the University of Chicago.

This is a program designed to push boundaries—both in thought and in practice. Our curriculum is grounded in rigorous analytical training, principled computational approaches, and a deep respect for the power of data to shape our world responsibly.

As Director, I’m excited to support your growth not only as data scientists, but as thinkers, collaborators, and future leaders in a rapidly evolving field. You’ll find here a vibrant academic community, dedicated faculty, and an ecosystem that spans disciplines—from computational sciences and information theory to the social sciences and humanities.

This handbook will guide you through your academic journey. I encourage you to explore it—and make the most of the opportunities ahead.

We’re glad you’re here. Now let’s get to work.

Warm regards,  
**Edwin Lo**  
Director, MSDS Program  
Data Science Institute
