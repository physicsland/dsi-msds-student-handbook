### Q: How can I find elective courses?
**A:** Graduate-level (300+ level) DATA, CMCS, and STAT courses that award a letter grade typically count as electives. Reading or research courses do not. For courses outside these departments, send the course syllabus to the MSDS Director for pre-approval before the quarter begins. If the upcoming syllabus isn’t yet available, a recent version from the same instructor may be used for temporary approval, pending submission of the final version.
