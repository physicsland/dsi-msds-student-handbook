The MSDS program provides students with access to robust computational infrastructure and learning environments to support coursework, research, and collaboration.

## Computing Infrastructure

### Account Setup & Management

Students will receive DSI computing accounts upon matriculation, providing access to shared resources, project directories, and software environments.

### High-Performance Computing (HPC) Resources

Students may request access to the universityâ€™s high-performance computing clusters for coursework or research-related tasks. Instructions for requesting access and usage guidelines are available on the DSI intranet or by contacting technical support.

## Software and Tools

Students have access to a suite of software tools for data science including (but not limited to):
- Python and R
- JupyterHub and GitHub
- Docker and VS Code
- Licensed statistical and ML packages (e.g., SAS, Stata, MATLAB, PyTorch, TensorFlow)

Software availability may depend on licensing agreements; additional tools can be requested through the support team.

## Facilities and Lab Spaces

Students are welcome to use designated lab spaces equipped with workstations, whiteboards, and collaboration tools. Reservations may be required for certain facilities.

## Campus Map and Building Locations

DSI spaces are primarily located in the John Crerar Library building. Students can reference the [University of Chicago Campus Map](https://maps.uchicago.edu) to locate classrooms, labs, and computing centers.
