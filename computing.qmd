The MSDS program provides students with access to robust computational infrastructure and learning environments to support coursework, research, and collaboration.


## Computational Resources

The University provides robust technical support: 

- [Software licenses from IT](https://its.uchicago.edu/students/) (Google G Suite, MS Office 365, Box, Zoom, and more)
- [IT support services](https://its.uchicago.edu/support/) for troubleshooting and assistance


## DSI Computing Clusters

Students will have access to the [DSI computing clusters](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/the-clinic/blob/main/tutorials/ssh_github_cluster.md) upon matriculation.

Bennett Hunter is our Senior System Administrator at DSI in charge of the cluster.



## Facilities and Lab Spaces

Students are welcome to use designated lab spaces equipped with workstations, whiteboards, and collaboration tools. Reservations may be required for certain facilities.

## Campus Map and Building Locations

DSI spaces are primarily located in the John Crerar Library building and Ryerson Lab second floor. Students can reference the [University of Chicago Campus Map](https://maps.uchicago.edu) to locate classrooms, labs, and computing centers.
