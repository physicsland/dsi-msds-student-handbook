### Registration and Course Enrollment

Students are required to register for courses through the university’s my.UChicago portal each quarter. Changes to registration must be made during the official add/drop period.

### Academic Integrity Policy

All students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty. Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty are strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.

Refer to the [University’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic-integrity/) for detailed guidance.

### Attendance and Participation Expectations

Regular attendance and active participation are expected in all courses. Instructors may set additional attendance policies specific to their course.
