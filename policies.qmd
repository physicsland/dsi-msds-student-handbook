The MSDS program follows the academic policies set by the [University’s standard](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic-policies/). Additional provisions relevant to our program’s structure and expectations are listed here.

## Registration and Course Enrollment

Students are required to register for courses through the university’s my.UChicago portal each quarter. Changes to registration must be made during the official add/drop period. Some general notes regarding class registrations and add/drops: 

- **Pass/Fail** Classes not earning letter grades do not fulfill the MSDS course requirements.    
- **Withdrawal/Refund** Univerisity policy allows students to withdraw from a class at any time up until final exam date, or final project due date.  
  * Up to the end of the third week of class, a withdrawal will remove the registration information from the transcript. Tuition will be refunded 100%  
  * After the third week, a 'W' grade will remain on the transcript, tuition is not refunded, and there will be a late change registration fee.  
  * A withdrawal might affect the full-time status, which could be crucial for international students.  
- **Add/drop** After the first full-week of class, all add/drops typically require the instructor and our administrative approval. This cannot be done via my.UChicago portal.  
  * After the third full week of class, there will be a late change registration fee.


## Time to Complete the MSDS Program

Students can take from one to two (consecutive) years to complete all program requirements. When all course requirements have been fulfilled, students may elect to continue part-time to complete their research requirements. International students should consult with [OIA](https://internationalaffairs.uchicago.edu) regarding the up-do-date visa restrictions. 


## Academic Honesty Code

All students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty. Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty are strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.

Refer to the [University’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic-policies/) for detailed guidance.


## GPA, Academic Progression and Probation

Students should maintain their (cumulative) GPA at or above 3.0, and make satisfactory academic progression. The following conditions may cause the student to be placed on Academic Probation:

- Cumulative GPA, all courses, below 3.0
- Cumulative GPA, MSDS core plus elective courses, below 3.3
- Receives one or more letter grades below 'C-' in a quarter
- Receives two or more Withdrawals 'W', Incompletes 'I', or blank grades in a single quarter
- Violate the academic honesty code 

Students on probation cannot take more than 300 units of credits in the quarter. A second time the student is placed under probation will be dismissed from the program.


## Student Concerns and Grievances

Should there be any concerns or disputes regarding classes, assignments, gradings, and other matters relating to the education and research in the program, the chain of communications to address should be: 

- **Instructor** if it is pertaining to a course.
- **Chair** of the program/department, if applicable.
- **MSDS Director** 
- **DSI Director** 
- **PSD Dean of Students** 



## Leave of Absence and Withdrawal Policies

Students seeking a leave of absence or withdrawal must submit a formal request and consult with the program director. Leaves are granted for medical, personal, or professional reasons.

## Disciplinary Procedures

Violations of academic or behavioral policies are subject to the university’s disciplinary procedures. These may include warnings, probation, suspension, or dismissal depending on the severity of the infraction.
