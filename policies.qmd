The MSDS program follows the academic policies set by the [University’s standard](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic-policies/). Additional provisions relevant to our program’s structure and expectations are listed here.

## Registration and Course Enrollment

Students are required to register for courses through the university’s my.UChicago portal each quarter. Changes to registration must be made during the official add/drop period. Some general notes regarding class registrations and add/drops: 

- **Pass/Fail** Classes not earning letter grades do not fullfill the MDSD course requirements.  
- **Withdrawal/Refund** Univerisity policy allow students to withdraw from a classat any time up until final exam date, or final project due date. 
  * Up to the end of the third week of class, a withdrawal will remove the registration information from the transcript. Tuition will be refunded 100%  
  * After the third week, a 'W' grade will remain on the transcript, tuition is not refunded, and there will be a late change registration fee.  
  * A withdrawal might affect the full-time status, which could be crucial for international students.  
- **Add/drop** After the first full-week of class, all add/drops typically require the instructor and our administrative approval. This cannot be done via my.UChicago portal.  
  * After the third full week of class, there will be a late change registration fee.


## Time to Complete the MSDS Program

Students can take from one to two (consecutive) years to complete all program requirements. When all course requirments have been fullfilled, students may elect to continue part-time to complete their research requirements. International students should consult with [OIA](https://internationalaffairs.uchicago.edu) regarding the up-do-date visa restrictions. 


## Academic Honesty Code

All students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty. Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty are strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.
