The MSDS program is committed to providing comprehensive support to ensure student success throughout the academic journey.

## Academic Advising

The MSDS Director is available to assist with course selection, program requirements, and academic planning questions. Please schedule an appointment via the links and contact info listed on the "Administrative Contacts" section. 

## Career Services

There are three main offices offering career service advising to our MSDS students: 

- [UChicagoGRAD](https://grad.uchicago.edu/career-development/)
- [PSD Career Service](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/current-students/career-services/)
- [DSI MSADS Career Service](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) (online workshops are available to our MSDS students)

They provide a combinations of:  

- Resume and cover letter workshops
- Interview preparation sessions
- Networking events with industry professionals
- Internship and job placement assistance

Students are encouraged to take advantage of these Career Service opportunites early on, not just close to graduation. A lot of the skills learned through these take time to develope and improve. The skills are also very helpful with looking for research opportunities and internships, which happens early in the program, long before your graduation.
