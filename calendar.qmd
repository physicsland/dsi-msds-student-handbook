## Academic Calendar and Important Dates

The MSDS program follows the University of Chicagoâ€™s quarter system. Students typically enroll in the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quarters, with some optional offerings in the Summer quarter.

### Quarterly Schedule

Students are expected to enroll in three courses per quarter to maintain full-time status. Important dates for each quarter, such as the start and end of classes, holidays, and exam periods, follow the University's academic calendar.

Refer to the [UChicago Academic Calendar](https://registrar.uchicago.edu/calendars/academic-calendars/) for the most up-to-date information.

### Key Deadlines

Students should adhere to the following important deadlines throughout the academic year:

- **Registration Deadlines**: Dates by which students must complete course registration or submit changes.
- **Course Add/Drop Period**: Time frame in which students may adjust their course enrollments without penalty.
- **Research Proposal Submission**: Deadline for submitting research proposals for approval (typically mid-Winter quarter).
- **Graduation Application**: Deadline for applying to graduate, generally early in the Spring quarter.

Students are encouraged to review their my.UChicago portal regularly and consult with academic advisors to stay informed of program-specific dates and requirements.
