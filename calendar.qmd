## Academic Calendar and Important Dates

The MSDS program follows the University of Chicagoâ€™s quarter system. Students typically enroll in the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quarters, with some optional offerings in the Summer quarter.

### Quarterly Schedule

Students are expected to enroll in three courses per quarter to maintain full-time status. If you are enrolling LESS than OR MORE than three courses (300 units), please contact the program administrator or the program director immediately. International students are required to maintain full-time status (see [Office of International Affairs OIA](https://internationalaffairs.uchicago.edu) for details) with some exceptions. 

Important dates for each quarter, such as the start and end of classes, holidays, and exam periods, please follow the [University's academic calendar](https://www.uchicago.edu/en/education-and-research/academic-calendar) for the most up-to-date and official information.

### Key Deadlines

Students should adhere to the following important deadlines throughout the academic year:

- **Registration Deadlines**: Follow these [dates set by the university](https://registrar.uchicago.edu/calendars/registration-dates-deadlines/) by which students must complete course registration or submit changes. [Registration timeline and procedures](https://college.uchicago.edu/advising/registration) can also be found here.
- **Course Add/Drop Period**: Time frame in which students may adjust their course enrollments without penalty. Typically, after the first week of class in any quarter, students will need instructors' approval and submit the request to our program administrator to add/change a course registration. 
- **Research Proposal Submission**: You should submit your research proposals to the director for approval as soon it is conceptualized. This will ensure the scope and direction of the research is acceptable before you spend time on it. In any case, the proposal should be submitted before the start of the quarter in which you plan to graduate.
- **Graduation Application**: Deadline for applying to graduate, generally is the first full week of the quarter you plan to graduate. The official guidelines can be found on [Physcial Science Division PSD weblink](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/current-students/graduation-and-degree-application/) here.
